# Seven Terraces! – Third milestone project

Seven Terraces is an app that allows its users to save their properties online and edit them anytime they need to. This app also allows the users to share their properties with other users, save the properties that they like and contact the admin if they have enquiries. 

The app also gives the users the option to search for properties based on names and descriptions. 

See below the link to the website:

- The final website differs from the original wire-frames because, when working on the design, I sometimes I found more appropriate ways to display the different sections.
